### Instructions

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) globally.

2. Install Gulp and the other Node packages. This may take a while:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```
   gulp serve
   ```

4. Edit the [data](https://github.com/santhoshvai/portfolio/tree/master/app/data) and
   [media](https://github.com/santhoshvai/portfolio/tree/master/app/media) files. Your
   changes should show up on in the browser immediately while `gulp serve` is still
   running.

5. When you're done, generate the minified HTML/JavaScript/CSS/media files:

   ```
   gulp
   ```
